# Aleksandir's Micro Projects

This repo holds many small projects that do not require their own. Most are written as a way to learn Python and many associated libraries.

If any tutorials were used, you will find the link to the tutorial in a comment at the top of the file. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Below are some links to future projects I would like to do, as well as some ideas I have had. I am always open to suggestions for new projects, so feel free to contact me with any ideas you have. I will also be adding more projects to this list as I think of them.

They are ordered by difficulty using the Fibonacci sequence so that I can easily pick a project to work on based on how much time I have. As I complete projects, I will remove them from the table.
