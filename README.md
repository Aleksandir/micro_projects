# Aleksandir's Micro Projects

This repo holds many small projects that do not require their own. Most are written as a way to learn Python and many associated libraries.

If any tutorials were used, you will find the link to the tutorial in a comment at the top of the file. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Below are some links to future projects I would like to do, as well as some ideas I have had. I am always open to suggestions for new projects, so feel free to contact me with any ideas you have. I will also be adding more projects to this list as I think of them.

They are ordered by difficulty using the Fibonacci sequence so that I can easily pick a project to work on based on how much time I have. As I complete projects, I will remove them from the table.

If you wish to run any of the projects, you will need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of this repo. Please note that requirements.txt is quite large due to it including all the libraries I have used in all the projects. If you wish to only install the libraries for a specific project, you can find the required libraries based on the imports at the top of the file. if the file is multi-file, I'll have a requirements.txt in the folder.
